Gear

Why it exists ?
---------------
I find out that, if you are writing java with your blood-hand. It is quit inconvenient.
You can find out lots of Java util packages. For example: Guava, Apache Common. 
For my opinion, These jar do too much but it doesn't enough. 
This projection is core projection in Gear family jar system. 
It is useful -- I already use it for working so long.
Have fun!!
